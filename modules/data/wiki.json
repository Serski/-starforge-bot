      "content": "Born from war, left to rot, and reclaimed by grit, Outpost Aegir is a relic that refuses to die.\n\nFounded in 2490 as a Federation early-warning station after the First Dominion War, Aegir orbited a gas giant rich in fuel. But by 2560, it was deemed obsolete and sold to Hyperion Strategic Systems, who turned it into a frontier freeport.\n\nWhen Hyperion collapsed in 2634, the station spiraled into chaos: blackouts, mutinies, and starvation. In 2648, the surviving factions forged the Aegir Compact, a civic alliance to preserve life-support, trade, and fragile order. Halvran Canto led it. His son, Jorell, took power after Halvran's suspicious death in 2662, transforming governance into oligarchic patronage backed by the Old Station Families.\n\nNow, in 2696, Aegir limps forward — rusted, half-lit, but functional. Neither Federation nor Dominion cares enough to claim it. Yet markets churn, secrets trade hands, and the station breathes through inertia and ambition.",

      "content": "Outpost Aegir is ruled not by law, but by favors, fear, and inertia.\n\nAt its heart sits Jorell Canto, self-styled Mayor-Magistrate, who inherited power after the mysterious death of his father, Halvran. Officially, he’s the “Keeper of the Compact.” Unofficially, he’s a king without a crown, balancing bribes, grudges, and ancestral loyalty.\n\nCanto governs through patronage, not policy. The Station Guard answers only to him. The Council of Accord, once a democratic body, now exists for optics, a ceremonial puppet show for faction appeasement and public distraction. Justice is a marketplace. Bribes are standardized. Favoritism is codified. From elevator permits to corpse disposal, everything has a price. Canto’s grip is strong but rotting.\n\nUnion whispers stir in the lower decks. Radiation deaths rise. Federation eyes return. And Jorell has no heir, unless the clone rumors are true. Aegir’s government survives like everything else here: barely, and with a lie on its tongue.",

Drone pods skim its upper shell, feeding data to long-neglected orbital sensors. Somewhere in that thinning air sits the Mayor’s office, surrounded by half-operational defense turrets and the brittle skeleton of Federation administration.\n\nBelow, residential stacks descend by class and oxygen allotment. The main market pulses with noise and trade at the core, flanked by ore and gas bays, jury-rigged labs, and greenhouses that glow unconvincingly in recycled light.\n\nAt the bottom, in the heat and shadow, lie the Level 0 habs — crammed, corroded, barely pressurized. Water recycling systems gurgle beside garbage chutes, volatile gas tanks, and the station’s oldest reactors, which mutter warnings in the language of heat.",
